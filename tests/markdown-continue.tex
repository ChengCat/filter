## Lists ##

Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*`,
`+`, and `-`) as list markers. These three markers are
interchangeable. As an example, this:


    *   Candy.
    *   Gum.
    *   Booze.

gives:

*   Candy.
*   Gum.
*   Booze.
* This is a list
* that has **markdown** syntax
* does it _work_
